# Level Up Your Life
### Dan Cermak, Andrew Theismann, Joseph Hunt

The Problem we Solved:
------
We found most planner apps are not customizable, they are cut and dry. They don't have a fun factor to them. After spending hours looking through different planner apps we were unable to find an app that worked for us. We came up with the idea of the Level Up Your Life app, it's a top of the line, responsive, modern-day planner app. 
<br>

Details:
------
In the morning talking with coworkers over a cup of coffee, I would tell them about this new app we create called Level Up Your Life, you can download on your phone or use it on a tablet or computer. Our app has full CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete. I don't mean only in one model our app has full crud across the whole plate form. We wanted our user to have a fully customizable app, so they would have a more enjoyable experience. I would let them know you can sign up for free. After you create a login profile you can create your first planner. Your account can have multiple planners as you choose and only you can see your planners. <br>
You are directed to daily entries where you can pick the day to create an entry. Inside the entry details are our models for notes, tasks, meal plans, workouts they are a button click away.  With notes, you can edit a note to make a simple comment, like pick up milk. Under our task model, you can set the title, description, important, and recurring that is only if you want to create a task. You can easily assign a previous task if it was created. <br>
So you don't forget to eat you can add a meal plan, for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, you can be as detailed or just say call for uber eats. I was saving the best for last you can even assign workouts, What type of workout do you want to accomplish that day. How much time do you want to spend doing a workout it's up to you! <br>
All of the tasks and workout will be listed underneath the to-do column. When you finish a task or workout you can mark it as complete. we have a scoring system in place to add to the fun factor of our app. Even though we are giving you a fully customizable app we want you to have fun with it. After spending time doing marketing research we found that the best way to get our app out to the public eyes is by word of mouth.
