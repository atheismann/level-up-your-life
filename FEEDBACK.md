# FEEDBACK PROJECT 3

Team Alpha! Outstanding job all around. It's arguable that you three made the most complex routing we've seen for this project. I really loved how deep the models, and views go - flush with functionality as they say! It was great to see the home page after creating the planner, and setting up the day. Amazing feature to have a clear distinction between reoccurring tasks, and one-time tasks. 

All in all I felt Dan could have maintain better flow during presenting. You started off amazing, but then got distracted, and never really recovered from it. Joseph much better job presenting this time all around. Andrew, excellent job on the presentation. 

One thing I would suggest is revisiting the front-end, mainly the UX part of the app. I think this would have been able to make great use of a side navigation bar in conjunction with the header. This had a lot of data creation, and display, and having all of that easily accessible would have been great in overall navigation.
